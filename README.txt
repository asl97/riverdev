This mod is my 'watershed' mapgen (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=8609) with fewer biomes, 2 path/bridge networks, tunnels/fissures/caves, boulders, improved magma channels and mini-volcanos.
The mod will automatically select 'singlenode' mapgen and will spawn players at the surface but also scattered up to 1280n from world centre
To make your first torches search for coal in tunnel entrances, near sea level or rivers these entrances are sometimes sealed by stone (result of protecting against underground flooding).
Ores are a few nodes underground to prevent easy surface mining in the rocky mountains.
